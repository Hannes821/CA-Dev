1) What is Castle Age*, the RTS title you are currently working on?

We build a Real-Time Strategy Game, focused on field battles and sieges, but with a connected, versatile base-building aspect and nature simulation. Those aspects support each other. There will also be other, secondary means of winning the game by culture and religion, to allow a balanced and unpredictable gameplay.

**The historic setting is 1170-1250. (High Medieval Times)** 
Reasons:
- our RTS scale is a few square kilometers and hundreds of units
- the most feudal conflicts had been lesser nobility rivaling for their neighboring lands
- we want to exclude over-regional conflicts as we do not want to "politicize" our game. 
it rather should have a timeless appeal and just transport the core aspects of "chess"
- we search for reconstruction of common European high medieval culture to immerse people and tell stories, not stereotypes
- it is tactically more interesting and realistic to command small war bands in that era
- later medieval weapons (two-hand sword, bill, trebuchet) enter the battlefield, and earlier medieval weapons (javelins, skirmishers, axes) are still on the battlefield, allowing for a wide range of tactic options. Earlier ages lack this variety, and later ages focus on gunpowder and large-scale infantry.

**The general direction is thereby: Fairness and an open game**
- like in a chess game, we want all sides to have the same options
- not too many unit types but many options on how to use them (easy to learn, hard to master)
- strategic uncertainty is important, so there will be a fog of war
- stone paper scissors is the basic idea, and we extend it.

**Immersion (the "authenticity you feel") is important to us.**
Therefore, instantaneous technologies, building, and training of units do not exist;
all resources have to be obtained in production chains.
Battle Morale, Height Bonus, and Experience create a realistic scenario never seen in such a game.
We want to provide historic sites and real-world maps.
