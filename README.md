**What is this repository?**
This is an internal, confidential and commercial development build of our upcoming RTS game.
We have been working carefully for years with a dedicated team on it and will bring it to fruitiuon.

**What is your team like?**
We are roughly 10 people with a vision: make classic game design in contemporary technological implementation.
Infotainment, added value, culture, art, tactics, nature, resources and economy as well as society.
All these aspects are important in this game. It is an ambitious hybrid between battle tactics and build-up,
with peaceful alternatives for victory but focus on micromanagement in battle and simulation.

**Can I support you guys?**
Oh yes.

**frequently asked questions (FAQ)**
*name might be subject to change.*

1) What is Castle Age*, the RTS title you are currently working on?

We build a Real-Time Strategy Game, focused on field battles and sieges, but with a connected, versatile base-building aspect and nature simulation. Those aspects support each other. There will also be other, secondary means of winning the game by culture and religion, to allow a balanced and unpredictable gameplay.

**The historic setting is 1170-1250. (High Medieval Times)** 
Reasons:
- our RTS scale is a few square kilometers and hundreds of units
- the most feudal conflicts had been lesser nobility rivaling for their neighboring lands
- we want to exclude over-regional conflicts as we do not want to "politicize" our game. 
it rather should have a timeless appeal and just transport the core aspects of "chess"
- we search for reconstruction of common European high medieval culture to immerse people and tell stories, not stereotypes
- it is tactically more interesting and realistic to command small war bands in that era
- later medieval weapons (two-hand sword, bill, trebuchet) enter the battlefield, and earlier medieval weapons (javelins, skirmishers, axes) are still on the battlefield, allowing for a wide range of tactic options. Earlier ages lack this variety, and later ages focus on gunpowder and large-scale infantry.

**The general direction is thereby: Fairness and an open game**
- like in a chess game, we want all sides to have the same options
- not too many unit types but many options on how to use them (easy to learn, hard to master)
- strategic uncertainty is important, so there will be a fog of war
- stone paper scissors is the basic idea, and we extend it.

**Immersion (the "authenticity you feel") is important to us.**
Therefore, instantaneous technologies, building, and training of units do not exist;
all resources have to be obtained in production chains.
Battle Morale, Height Bonus, and Experience create a realistic scenario never seen in such a game.
We want to provide historic sites and real-world maps.
